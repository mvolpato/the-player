# Music Player: create a simple Flutter music player app

This is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) project used during a [series](https://ishouldgotosleep.com/tutorials/music-app/simple-flutter-music-player-app/) of articles
on [I should go to sleep](https://ishouldgotosleep.com).

## Part 1: create the project and add basic buttons

In the [first part](https://ishouldgotosleep.com/tutorials/music-app/simple-flutter-music-player-app/) we 
create the Flutter project and play some music from the Internet by using 
the package [just_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio).
